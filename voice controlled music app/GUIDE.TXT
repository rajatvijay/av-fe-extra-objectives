I completed this project by taking reference from sample project on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API#Examples
Let me cover it in short
1.Boiler plate code //Isse copy karna hai bas
var result
var SpeechRecognition = SpeechRecognition || webkitSpeechRecognition
var SpeechGrammarList = SpeechGrammarList || webkitSpeechGrammarList
var SpeechRecognitionEvent = SpeechRecognitionEvent || webkitSpeechRecognitionEvent
THE ABOVE CODE IS USED TO INITALIZER SpeechRecognition

2.

var options = ['play the song', 'pause the song', 'loop through song', 'shuffle between songs', 'next song', 'previous song', 'show visualizer'];
var grammar = '#JSGF V1.0; grammar options; public <option> = ' + options.join(' | ') + ' ;'


THE ARRAY OPTIONS IS THE ARRAY WHERE WE SPECIFY WHICH WORDS ARE WE GOING TO USE WHEN WE WILL SPEAK
THE SECOND VARIABLE GRAMMER IS AGAIN BOILER PLATE CODE WHICH I PICKED FROM THERE DOCUMENTATION IT'S ROLE IS TO COMBINE THE WORDS GIVEN BY US TO PREDIFENED STRING AND CONCATINATE

3.
var recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
var speechRecognitionList = new SpeechGrammarList();
speechRecognitionList.addFromString(grammar, 1);
recognition.grammars = speechRecognitionList;
//recognition.continuous = false;
recognition.lang = 'en-US';
recognition.interimResults = false;
recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;


AGAIN BOILER PLATE CODE JUST COPY THE SAME .BASICALLY THEY ARE CREATING INSTANCES OF OBJECTS OF SpeechRecognition AND SpeechGrammarList BUT LETS NOT CONFUSE STUDENTS


4. $('.fa-microphone').click(function() {
    $('.fa-microphone').removeClass("active");
    recognition.start();

})


I CREATED A MICROPHONE IN MY HTML FILE AND WHEN WE CLICK IT RECOGNITION STARTS THIS WILL ENABLE YOUR MICROPHONE AND WILL START TAKING INPUT


5.recognition.onresult = function(event) {
    // The SpeechRecognitionEvent results property returns a SpeechRecognitionResultList object
    // The SpeechRecognitionResultList object contains SpeechRecognitionResult objects.
    // It has a getter so it can be accessed like an array
    // The [last] returns the SpeechRecognitionResult at the last position.
    // Each SpeechRecognitionResult object contains SpeechRecognitionAlternative objects that contain individual results.
    // These also have getters so they can be accessed like arrays.
    // The [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionAlternative at position 0.
    // We then return the transcript property of the SpeechRecognitionAlternative object

    var last = event.results.length - 1;
    result = event.results[last][0].transcript;
    console.log(result);
}


HERE IS THE POINT WHERE MAIN MAGIC STARTS NOW WHEN YOU SPEAK A RESULT IS CAPTURED AND STORED IN EVENT OBJECT UNDER DOUBLE RESULT ARRAY  JUST SAVE TAHT IN A VARIABLE LIKE I SAVED IT IN RESULT
AND YUP YOU ARE GOOD TO GO AT THE END JUST APPLY SIMPLE IF CONDITIOINS

if (result == "play the song") {
    $('.fa-microphone').addClass("active");
    var song = document.querySelector('audio');
    $('.play-icon').removeClass('fa-play').addClass('fa-pause');
    song.play();

}

WARING BE SPECIFIC WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU SAY PLAY THIS CAN TAKE IT AS CLAY SO PREFFER SPEAKING PLAY THE SONG
